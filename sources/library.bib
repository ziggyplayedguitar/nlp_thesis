  abstract = {Various techniques based on artificial intelligence have been proposed for the automatic detection of online anti-social behaviors, both in existing systems and in the scientific literature. In this article, we describe TrollPacifier, a holistic system for troll detection, which analyses many different features of trolls and legitimate users on the popular Twitter platform. In this system, the most known and promising approaches and research lines are applied, along with original new ideas, in a form that fits such a large public platform. In particular, we have identified six groups of features, based respectively on the analysis of writing style, sentiment, behaviors, social interactions, linked media, and publication time. As its main scientific contributions, this work provides: (i) an up-to-date analysis of the state of the art for the problem of troll detection; (ii) the systematic collection and grouping of features, on Twitter; (iii) the description of a working holistic system for troll detection, with a very high accuracy (95.5\%); and (iv) a comparison among the different features, with a machine learning approach. Our results demonstrate that automatic classification can be useful in the whole process of identification and management of online anti-social behaviors. However, a multi-faceted approach is required, in order to obtain an adequate accuracy.},

Specifically, state-affiliated actors disguise themselves as native citizens of the United States to promote discord and promote their political motives. Therefore, developing methods to automatically detect Russian trolls can ensure fair elections and possibly reduce political extremism by stopping trolls that produce discord. While data exists for some troll organizations (e.g., Internet Research Agency), it is challenging to collect ground-truth accounts for new troll farms in a timely fashion. In this paper, we study the impact the number of labeled troll accounts has on detection performance. We analyze the use of self-supervision with less than 100 troll accounts as training data. We improve classification performance by nearly 4\% F1. Furthermore, in combination with self-supervision, we also explore novel features for troll detection grounded in stylometry. Intuitively, we assume that the writing style is consistent across troll accounts because a single troll organization employee may control multiple user accounts. Overall, we improve on models based on words features by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde9\% F1.},

Virtually all companies and public figures have social media accounts on popular platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In China, the micro-blogging service provider, Sina Weibo, is the most popular such service. To influence public opinion, Weibo trolls -- the so called Water Army -- can be hired to post deceptive comments. In this paper, we focus on troll detection via sentiment analysis and other user activity data on the Sina Weibo platform. We implement techniques for Chinese sentence segmentation, word embedding, and sentiment score calculation. In recent years, troll detection and sentiment analysis have been studied, but we are not aware of previous research that considers troll detection based on sentiment analysis. We employ the resulting techniques to develop and test a sentiment analysis approach for troll detection, based on a variety of machine learning strategies. Experimental results are generated and analyzed. A Chrome extension is presented that implements our proposed technique, which enables real-time troll detection when a user browses Sina Weibo.},

In this paper we will go into these problems, and suggest that a reinterpretation of current and historical methods in the framework and methodology of machine learning of natural language processing would be helpful. We also argue for more attention in research for explanation in computational stylometry as opposed to purely quantitative evaluation measures and propose a strategy for data collection and analysis for achieving progress in computational stylometry. We also introduce a fairly new application of computational stylometry in internet security.},

  abstract = {The past few years were marked by increased online offensive strategies perpetrated by state and non-state actors to promote their political agenda, sow discord, and question the legitimacy of democratic institutions in the US and Western Europe. In 2016, the US congress identified a list of Russian state-sponsored Twitter accounts that were used to try to divide voters on a wide range of issues. Previous research used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to estimate latent topics in data extracted from these accounts. However, LDA has characteristics that may limit the effectiveness of its use on data from social media: The number of latent topics must be specified by the user, interpretability of the topics can be difficult to achieve, and it does not model short-term temporal dynamics. In the current paper, we propose a new method to estimate latent topics in texts from social media termed Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA). In a Monte Carlo simulation, we compared the ability of DynEGA and LDA to estimate the number of simulated latent topics. The results show that DynEGA is substantially more accurate than several different LDA algorithms when estimating the number of simulated topics. In an applied example, we performed DynEGA on a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 US presidential election. DynEGA revealed topics that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the USA. This example demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data.},

  abstract               = {Topic modeling is a popular technique for exploring large document collections. It has proven useful for this task, but its application poses a number of challenges. First, the comparison of available algorithms is anything but simple, as researchers use many different datasets and criteria for their evaluation. A second challenge is the choice of a suitable metric for evaluating the calculated results. The metrics used so far provide a mixed picture, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of topic modeling outputs. Altogether, the choice of an appropriate algorithm and the evaluation of the results remain unresolved issues. Although many studies have reported promising performance by various topic models, prior research has not yet systematically investigated the validity of the outcomes in a comprehensive manner, that is, using more than a small number of the available algorithms and metrics. Consequently, our study has two main objectives. First, we compare all commonly used, non-application-specific topic modeling algorithms and assess their relative performance. The comparison is made against a known clustering and thus enables an unbiased evaluation of results. Our findings show a clear ranking of the algorithms in terms of accuracy. Secondly, we analyze the relationship between existing metrics and the known clustering, and thus objectively determine under what conditions these algorithms may be utilized effectively. This way, we enable readers to gain a deeper understanding of the performance of topic modeling techniques and the interplay of performance and evaluation metrics.},

More specifically, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based TF-IDF procedure. BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

The main challenges of topic modeling are finding the optimal number of topics, labeling the topics, segmenting documents by topic, and evaluating topic model performance. Current neural approaches have tackled some of these problems but none have been able to solve all of them. We introduce a novel topic modeling approach, Contextual-Top2Vec, which uses document contextual token embeddings, it creates hierarchical topics, finds topic spans within documents and labels topics with phrases rather than just words. We propose the use of BERTScore to evaluate topic coherence and to evaluate how informative topics are of the underlying documents.
