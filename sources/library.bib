  abstract = {Various techniques based on artificial intelligence have been proposed for the automatic detection of online anti-social behaviors, both in existing systems and in the scientific literature. In this article, we describe TrollPacifier, a holistic system for troll detection, which analyses many different features of trolls and legitimate users on the popular Twitter platform. In this system, the most known and promising approaches and research lines are applied, along with original new ideas, in a form that fits such a large public platform. In particular, we have identified six groups of features, based respectively on the analysis of writing style, sentiment, behaviors, social interactions, linked media, and publication time. As its main scientific contributions, this work provides: (i) an up-to-date analysis of the state of the art for the problem of troll detection; (ii) the systematic collection and grouping of features, on Twitter; (iii) the description of a working holistic system for troll detection, with a very high accuracy (95.5\%); and (iv) a comparison among the different features, with a machine learning approach. Our results demonstrate that automatic classification can be useful in the whole process of identification and management of online anti-social behaviors. However, a multi-faceted approach is required, in order to obtain an adequate accuracy.},

  abstract   = {Social media has reportedly been (ab)used by Russian troll farms to promote political agendas. Specifically, state-affiliated actors disguise themselves as native citizens of the United States to promote discord and promote their political motives. Therefore, developing methods to automatically detect Russian trolls can ensure fair elections and possibly reduce political extremism by stopping trolls that produce discord. While data exists for some troll organizations (e.g., Internet Research Agency), it is challenging to collect ground-truth accounts for new troll farms in a timely fashion. In this paper, we study the impact the number of labeled troll accounts has on detection performance. We analyze the use of self-supervision with less than 100 troll accounts as training data. We improve classification performance by nearly 4\% F1. Furthermore, in combination with self-supervision, we also explore novel features for troll detection grounded in stylometry. Intuitively, we assume that the writing style is consistent across troll accounts because a single troll organization employee may control multiple user accounts. Overall, we improve on models based on words features by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde9\% F1.},

  abstract     = {The impact of social media on the modern world is difficult to overstate. Virtually all companies and public figures have social media accounts on popular platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In China, the micro-blogging service provider, Sina Weibo, is the most popular such service. To influence public opinion, Weibo trolls -- the so called Water Army -- can be hired to post deceptive comments. In this paper, we focus on troll detection via sentiment analysis and other user activity data on the Sina Weibo platform. We implement techniques for Chinese sentence segmentation, word embedding, and sentiment score calculation. In recent years, troll detection and sentiment analysis have been studied, but we are not aware of previous research that considers troll detection based on sentiment analysis. We employ the resulting techniques to develop and test a sentiment analysis approach for troll detection, based on a variety of machine learning strategies. Experimental results are generated and analyzed. A Chrome extension is presented that implements our proposed technique, which enables real-time troll detection when a user browses Sina Weibo.},

This study carries out an analysis of four widely used datasets to explore how different types of features affect authorship attribution accuracy under varying conditions. The results of the analysis are applied to authorship attribution models based on both discrete and continuous representations. We apply the conclusions from our analysis to an extension of an existing approach to authorship attribution and outperform the prior state-of-the-art on two out of the four datasets used.},
